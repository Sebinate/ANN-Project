# End-to-End ANN Project in Customer Churn Prediction
An Artificial Neural Network designed to solve binary classification problem regarding customer churn, accessible via a streamlit web application.

## Overview
This project implements a Feedforward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict, given a set of indicators and predictors from the Churn_Modelling.csv dataset, the probability of a particular customer churning. The model is built using pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Tensorflow and is optimized for Accuracy.

## Interaction Layer
Users interact with this model through a streamlit web application. 
* **Interaction Type:** Web Application
* **Key Functionality:** Users can upload a CSV file to receive batch predictions, and individual predictions.
